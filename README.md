- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xx437

I have gotten myself into a bit of trouble. My curiosity has bested me yet again... 
Apparently coding is a good way to explore concepts, create, and have fun. So I just made this to mess around
with some projects, mostly related to C. I dunno something about this language is really attractive. I am by 
no means a programmer, so I expect to make a few mistakes and struggle.

Also a fan of Lisp, maybe it is the fact that these languages have been around for sometime now that has me hooked.
Anyways these are just the thoughts that came up in my mind when I created this account.
